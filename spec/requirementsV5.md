### Key Points
- It seems likely that most functional stories are covered by the existing requirements and within the charter's scope, focusing on data storage and access control.
- Research suggests some stories, like offline data access and notifications, may need new requirements to ensure full coverage.
- The evidence leans toward adding specific requirements for features like large file uploads and context-aware access, aligning with user needs and charter goals.

### Coverage Analysis
The provided requirements address core aspects like unique identifiers, storage control, and data sharing, which align with many functional stories. However, some advanced features, such as offline data access and real-time notifications, appear uncovered and may require additional requirements to ensure comprehensive support.

### New Requirements Needed
Based on the analysis, new requirements are proposed for features not fully addressed, such as:
- Offline data access with synchronization.
- Support for large file uploads, including resumable transfers.
- Notifications for permission changes and updates.
- Context-aware access control based on factors like time or location.
- Search functionality for efficient resource retrieval.

These additions aim to enhance user experience while staying within the charter's scope of defining a web protocol for data management and security.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Functional Stories and Requirements

This analysis evaluates whether the provided functional stories, derived from user needs and issues in a GitHub repository (likely related to the Linked Web Storage project), are covered by the given requirements and fall within the scope of the [Linked Web Storage Working Group Charter](https://www.w3.org/2024/09/linked-web-storage-wg-charter.html). The charter, effective as of 2025, outlines a web protocol for applications to authenticate users and store data with user-chosen servers, emphasizing interoperability, user control, and privacy, while excluding new identity mechanisms, data formats, or unique Personal Data Store solutions.

The requirements provided are:
1. **Globally Unique Identifiers**: Resources, including Entities and Storages, must have unique identifiers globally, with no two distinct resources sharing the same identifier, though collectives are allowed, and owners can prove control.
2. **Use of Service Providers**: Entities can delegate functions to trusted Service Providers, with non-transitive trust relationships, without impeding self-hosting.
3. **Control of Storages**: An Entity can control one or more Storages across providers, with each Storage having one Controller.
4. **Delegation of Control**: Entities can delegate Storage control to another Entity, temporarily or permanently, with the ability to modify or revoke later.
5. **Transfer of Control**: Entities can irrevocably transfer Storage control to another Entity.
6. **Storage Portability**: Entities can move Storage contents between providers, freeing the previous provider from responsibility.
7. **Adding, Updating, Deleting Resources in Storage**: Authorized Entities can perform CRUD operations on Resources, with possible provider limitations.
8. **Data Sharing**: Entities can grant access to Resources for operations like read/modify/remove, with temporary or permanent grants, modifiable later.
9. **Auditable Trail**: Authorized Entities can access logs of access requests, grants, and Resource operations.
10. **Serialization Format**: Data in Storage can be serialized in a known format.

The functional stories are categorized into Data Management, Access Control and Sharing, Collaboration and Communication, Application Integration, Advanced Features, Non-Functional Stories, and Technical Stories, each with specific user needs and associated GitHub issues.

#### Methodology
Each story was assessed for:
1. **Scope Alignment**: Does it fit within the charter's focus on a web protocol for authentication, data storage, and user control, excluding new identity mechanisms or data formats?
2. **Coverage by Requirements**: Is it addressed by one or more of the 10 requirements?
3. **Gaps and New Requirements**: If within scope but not covered, a new requirement was proposed, ensuring it aligns with charter goals.

#### Detailed Analysis by Category

Notifications aspect not covered; see below for proposed requirement.
- **Notifications for Permission Changes**: Collaborators want notifications for permission changes to stay informed. Not covered by current requirements, as Requirement 9 (Auditable Trail) is about logging, not real-time notifications. Within scope, as it enhances user experience. Proposed Requirement 13: "Notifications: The protocol shall support notifying entities about changes in permissions or other relevant events related to their resources."
- **Profile Sharing**: Users want multiple profiles with distinct access controls for different contexts. Partially covered by Requirement 1 (Resources, including Entities, can have multiple identifiers) and Requirement 8 (Data Sharing), assuming profiles are managed via existing identity mechanisms. Within scope, as it aligns with user-chosen identity, but no new identity mechanisms needed. Considered covered, given charter's focus on existing systems.
- **Group Sharing**: Users want to share data with dynamic groups, updating automatically. Covered by Requirement 8, assuming groups are Entities with access grants, as it supports dynamic membership. Within scope, as it enhances collaboration.

#### Proposed New Requirements
Based on the analysis, the following requirements are added to ensure coverage of all within-scope stories:
11. Offline Data Access and Synchronization: The protocol shall support accessing and modifying data offline, with mechanisms for synchronizing changes when connectivity is restored, ensuring data consistency and avoiding conflicts.
12. Large File Handling: The protocol shall support efficient uploading of large files, including resumable uploads to handle interruptions.
13. Notifications: The protocol shall support notifying entities about changes in permissions or other relevant events related to their resources.
14. Context-Aware Access Control: The protocol shall support access control policies that take into account contextual factors such as time, location, or other attributes.
15. Search Functionality: The protocol shall support searching for resources within a storage based on various criteria, with appropriate access controls.
16. Data Encryption: The protocol shall support end-to-end encryption for data storage and transfers to ensure confidentiality.

These additions align with the charter's goals of enhancing user control, security, and interoperability, without introducing new identity mechanisms or data formats.

#### Conclusion
Most functional stories are covered by the existing requirements and are within the charter's scope, focusing on data storage, access control, and user experience. New requirements were proposed for offline access, large file handling, notifications, context-aware policies, search functionality, and encryption, ensuring comprehensive support for user needs while adhering to the charter's directives.
