An analysis of the user stories against the W3C Linked Web Storage (LWS) charter requirements is below.

### Coverage Analysis

The existing ten requirements of the LWS charter cover the majority of the functional, non-functional, and technical stories. The charter establishes a solid foundation for a decentralized, user-centric storage protocol.

* **Covered Stories**: Most stories concerning data management (CRUD, portability), access control (sharing, delegation), and core principles (unique IDs, serialization) are well-supported.
    * **Req #1 (`Globally Unique Identifiers`)** covers `Globally Unique Identifiers` and is fundamental to `Semantic Collaboration`.
    * **Req #2 (`Use of Service Providers`)** addresses the `Trust Mechanism for Storage Providers`.
    * **Req #3 (`Control of Storages`)** directly supports `Storage Ownership`.
    * **Req #4 (`Delegation of Control`)** is the basis for `Administrative Assistant`, `Health Record Access`, and `Delegation of Control`.
    * **Req #6 (`Storage Portability`)** directly enables `Portable Storage`.
    * **Req #7 (`Adding, Updating, Deleting Resources`)** covers the core functionality of `Generic Storage`.
    * **Req #8 (`Data Sharing`)** is the foundation for `Sharing Access`, `Profile Sharing`, and `Group Sharing`.
    * **Req #9 (`Auditable Trail`)** directly addresses `Legal Reporting` and `Consent-Based Sharing`.
    * **Req #10 (`Serialization Format`)** supports `Hypermedia Authoring`.
* **Partially Covered or Uncovered Stories**: Several stories introduce concepts that, while not contradicting the charter, are not explicitly mentioned in the initial ten requirements. These gaps highlight areas where the protocol specification may need new features.

### Stories Requiring New Requirements

The following stories are not fully covered by the existing requirements. The new requirements proposed below are designed to address these gaps while remaining within the scope of the LWS charter.

#### 1. Offline and Synchronization Capabilities
* **Relevant Stories**: `Offline Data Access` [#138](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/138), `Meeting Scheduling` [#3](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/3), `Storage Listening` [#101](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/101).
* **Analysis**: The current requirements focus on online client-server interactions but don't specify mechanisms for offline or intermittently connected clients. To ensure a robust user experience, the protocol needs to support data versioning, synchronization, and conflict resolution.
* **Proposed New Requirement**:
    > **11. &lt;dfn&gt;Data Synchronization&lt;/dfn&gt;** — The protocol shall provide mechanisms to support data synchronization, including resource versioning and conflict detection and resolution, to facilitate interoperability between clients that operate in offline or intermittently connected environments.

#### 2. Real-Time Notifications
* **Relevant Stories**: `Real-Time Notifications` [#32](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/32), `Application Notifications` [#100](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/100), `Notifications for Permission Changes` [#116](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/116).
* **Analysis**: The auditable trail (Req #9) is for reviewing past events, not for receiving real-time, push-based notifications. Modern applications and efficient collaboration depend on the ability to subscribe to resource updates.
* **Proposed New Requirement**:
    > **12. &lt;dfn&gt;Event Notifications&lt;/dfn&gt;** — The protocol shall define a mechanism for an authorized Entity to subscribe to and receive notifications about events, including the creation, modification, or deletion of Resources and changes in access grants.

#### 3. Advanced Querying and Search
* **Relevant Stories**: `Search Functionality` [#152](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/152), `Pagination & Filtering` [#103](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/103), `SPARQL Queries` [#45](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/45).
* **Analysis**: Requirement #7 covers basic CRUD but omits complex querying, filtering, or full-text search. A standardized, expressive query capability is essential for managing large datasets and realizing the "Linked Web" aspect of the project.
* **Proposed New Requirement**:
    > **13. &lt;dfn&gt;Querying&lt;/dfn&gt;** — The protocol shall provide a mechanism for an authorized Entity to perform queries on Resources within a Storage. This may include filtering, ordering, pagination, and, for structured data, the use of a standard query language such as SPARQL.

#### 4. Context-Dependent Access Control
* **Relevant Stories**: `Context-Aware Access Policies` [#17](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/17).
* **Analysis**: The data sharing requirement (Req #8) covers granting access to an entity but doesn't explicitly mention making these grants conditional on dynamic factors like time or location.
* **Proposed New Requirement**:
    > **14. &lt;dfn&gt;Context-Aware Access Control&lt;/dfn&gt;** — The protocol shall allow for the expression of conditional access grants. The enforcement of these grants may depend on contextual factors, such as time, location, or other attributes asserted by a trusted third party.

#### 5. Client-Side Encryption Support
* **Relevant Stories**: `End-to-End Encryption` [#4](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/4).
* **Analysis**: While security is a key consideration, the requirements do not explicitly mandate that the protocol must support end-to-end encryption where the storage provider cannot read the data. This is a critical privacy feature for many use cases.
* **Proposed New Requirement**:
    > **15. &lt;dfn&gt;Support for Encrypted Data&lt;/dfn&gt;** — The protocol shall not impede the ability for clients to implement end-to-end encryption. It should be possible to add, update, and delete opaque resources (i.e., encrypted blobs) and manage their access controls without the Storage Provider being able to decrypt their contents.
