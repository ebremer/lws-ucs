Below is an analysis of each user‐story against the ten core requirements you listed (1–10) and the Working Group’s charter scope (“define a web protocol for authentication + storage”). Stories not covered by any of 1–10 (but still in-scope) have been promoted to new high-level requirements at the end; stories that fall outside the charter’s focus on a storage protocol are noted as out of scope.

## 1. Data Management

| Story                   | Covered by Req(s) | In-Scope? |
| ----------------------- | :---------------: | :-------: |
| **Generic Storage**     |        1, 7       |     ✅     |
| **Portable Storage**    |         6         |     ✅     |
| **Offline Data Access** |         –         |     ✅     |
| **Large File Uploads**  |         –         |     ✅     |

* **Offline Data Access** and **Large File Uploads** aren’t addressed by Req 1–10 but are valid protocol-level concerns (automatic sync, resumable transfers) and should be added.

## 2. Access Control and Sharing

| Story                                    | Covered by Req(s) | In-Scope? |
| ---------------------------------------- | :---------------: | :-------: |
| **Sharing Access**                       |         8         |     ✅     |
| **Notifications for Permission Changes** |         –         |     ✅     |
| **Profile Sharing**                      |         –         |     ✅     |
| **Group Sharing**                        |         –         |     ✅     |
| **Administrative Assistant**             |        4, 9       |     ✅     |
| **Context-Aware Access Policies**        |         –         |     ✅     |
| **Health Record Access**                 |        8, 9       |     ✅     |

* Notifications, multiple-profile management, dynamic groups, and context-aware policies are not in Req 1–10 but align with “access management life-cycle” in the charter.

## 3. Collaboration & Communication

| Story                         | Covered by Req(s) |     In-Scope?     |
| ----------------------------- | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| **Meeting Scheduling**        |         –         |   ❌ (app layer)   |
| **Real-Time Notifications**   |         –         | ✅ (notifications) |
| **Application Notifications** |         –         | ✅ (notifications) |
| **Universal Communication**   |         –         | ❌ (messaging app) |
| **Polling**                   |         –         |  ❌ (app feature)  |
| **Semantic Collaboration**    |         –         |  ✅ (SPARQL + ACL) |

* Scheduling, general messaging and polls sit above the storage protocol: they’re best handled by applications built on top of LWS.
* Notifications (real-time or permission-change) and semantic co-authoring via SPARQL/ACL are protocol-level.

## 4. Application Integration

| Story                                    | Covered by Req(s) | In-Scope? |
| ---------------------------------------- | :---------------: | :-------: |
| **Personal Info Mgmt (Data Projection)** |         –         |     ✅     |
| **Bring-Your-Own-Data Apps**             |        7, 8       |     ✅     |
| **Digital Goods Delivery**               |        7, 9       |     ✅     |
| **Data Integration (APIs)**              |         –         |     ✅     |
| **Business Data Access**                 |         8         |     ✅     |

* Data transformation for external apps (“data projection”) and standardized query/integration APIs aren’t in Req 1–10 but are clearly in-scope.

| **Storage Listening**         |         –         |     ✅     |

* Query support (SPARQL), search, pagination, timeseries, website-style publishing, dynamic home-IP handling, contextual UIs, and offline client-side listening are all in-scope but lack mapping to Req 1–10.

* Modern auth methods (WebAuthn, passkeys) and local credential management aren’t spelled out in Req 1–10 but fall under the protocol’s “authentication” remit.

| **Backend Service Integration (mTLS, etc.)** |         –         |     ✅     |

* Alternate transport bindings and back-end auth modes are protocol-design concerns but not in Req 1–10.

## New Protocol Requirements

1. **Offline Data Access** — support local read/write with conflict-free sync upon reconnection
2. **Large/Resumable Uploads** — enable chunked, resumable transfers for large resources
3. **Notifications** — standardized event/notification mechanism for resource and permission changes
4. **Multiple Profile Management** — allow an Entity to maintain distinct sharing-profiles, each with its own ACLs
5. **Group-Based Access Control** — define dynamic groups of Entities as grantees, with automatic membership updates
6. **Context-Aware Access Policies** — ACLs that adapt based on context (time, geolocation, proximity)
7. **Query Interface Support** — standard API (e.g., SPARQL or RESTful search) for complex queries, pagination, and filtering
8. **Encryption & Consent Practices** — mandate end-to-end encryption and verifiable consent mechanisms
9. **Transport & Auth Flexibility** — permit alternative bindings (gRPC, WebSockets) and backend auth (mTLS, OIDC)

---

## Out-of-Scope Stories

* **Meeting Scheduling**, **Universal Communication**, **Polling** — these are higher-level application workflows, beyond the charter’s focus on defining a storage/authentication protocol.
