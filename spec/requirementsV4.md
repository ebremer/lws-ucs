# Additional Requirements for LWS Protocol

After reviewing the existing 10 requirements against the W3C Linked Web Storage Working Group Charter and the functional user stories, the following additional requirements should be added to ensure comprehensive coverage:

## 11. <dfn>Offline Functionality and Synchronization</dfn> 
The protocol shall support offline access to Resources, allowing Entities to read and modify cached data without network connectivity. Upon reconnection, the protocol shall provide mechanisms for automatic synchronization with conflict resolution to ensure data consistency across all devices and prevent data corruption.

*Coverage: Addresses "Offline Data Access" user story and enables local-first applications as mentioned in the charter's API protocol decoupling goals.*

## 12. <dfn>Real-time Notifications</dfn> 
The protocol shall provide mechanisms for real-time notifications to inform authorized Entities when Resources they have access to are created, modified, or deleted. Notifications shall respect access control policies and support both push-based and polling-based delivery methods.

*Coverage: Addresses "Real-Time Notifications" and "Application Notifications" user stories, and aligns with the charter's mention of "notifications about resource changes" in the protocol specification.*

## 13. <dfn>Data Integrity and Versioning</dfn> 
The protocol shall ensure data integrity through mechanisms such as checksums or cryptographic hashes. The protocol shall support versioning of Resources, allowing Entities to access previous versions and track changes over time. This includes support for recovering from data corruption and maintaining audit trails.

*Coverage: Addresses versioning, integrity, backup, and recovery concerns from the technical user stories and "Additional Covered Issues" section.*

## 14. <dfn>Search and Query Capabilities</dfn> 
The protocol shall provide standardized mechanisms for searching and querying Resources within Storages, including full-text search, metadata-based filtering, and semantic queries (such as SPARQL). Search results shall respect access control policies and support pagination and result ranking.

*Coverage: Addresses "Search Functionality", "Pagination & Filtering", and "SPARQL Queries" user stories, enabling efficient data discovery in large datasets.*

## 15. <dfn>Resumable and Efficient Data Transfer</dfn> 
The protocol shall support resumable uploads and downloads for large Resources, allowing transfers to be interrupted and resumed without data loss. The protocol shall also support efficient partial updates and delta synchronization to minimize bandwidth usage.

*Coverage: Addresses "Large File Uploads" user story and supports efficient data management for bandwidth-constrained environments.*

## 16. <dfn>End-to-End Encryption and Privacy</dfn> 
The protocol shall support end-to-end encryption for Resources, ensuring that only authorized Entities can decrypt and access the data. The protocol shall provide mechanisms for key management and support consent-based data sharing with verifiable audit trails for privacy compliance.

*Coverage: Addresses "End-to-End Encryption" and "Consent-Based Sharing" user stories, supporting privacy regulations like GDPR as mentioned in the charter's security considerations.*

## 17. <dfn>Context-Aware Access Control</dfn> 
The protocol shall support dynamic access control policies based on contextual factors such as time, location, device type, or relationship to other Entities. These policies shall be evaluated in real-time and allow for temporary or conditional access grants.

*Coverage: Addresses "Context-Aware Access Policies" user story and enables sophisticated access control scenarios required for enterprise and healthcare applications.*

## 18. <dfn>Resource Aggregation and Collections</dfn> 
The protocol shall provide mechanisms for creating and managing collections of Resources, including dynamic collections based on queries or metadata. Collections shall support nested structures and allow for bulk operations on multiple Resources while maintaining individual Resource access controls.

*Coverage: Addresses "Group Sharing" and collection management scenarios, enabling efficient organization and management of related Resources.*

## 19. <dfn>Service Provider Trust Relationships</dfn> 
The protocol shall define mechanisms for establishing and managing trust relationships between different Service Providers (Identity Providers, Storage Providers, etc.) while maintaining Entity autonomy. These trust relationships shall be explicit, non-transitive, and allow for cross-provider authentication and authorization.

*Coverage: Addresses the "Trust Mechanism for Storage Providers" technical story and supports the decentralized architecture described in the charter where multiple service providers must interoperate.*

## 20. <dfn>Performance and Scalability</dfn> 
The protocol shall be designed to support high-performance operations and scalable deployments. This includes efficient caching mechanisms, optimized request/response patterns, and support for content delivery networks. The protocol shall perform well under heavy load while maintaining security and access control guarantees.

*Coverage: Addresses "Performant Access Control" and scalability concerns from the non-functional user stories, ensuring the protocol can support production-scale deployments.*

## Rationale

These additional requirements ensure that the LWS protocol specification covers all the functional and non-functional user stories while staying within the charter's scope of "defin[ing] a web protocol that applications can use to authenticate users and store their data with user-chosen identity and storage servers."

The additions focus on:
- **Operational concerns** (offline functionality, performance, data integrity)
- **User experience** (notifications, search, resumable transfers)
- **Security and privacy** (encryption, consent management, context-aware access)
- **System architecture** (trust relationships, resource organization)

All additions align with the charter's goal of enabling "applications where data storage, entity authentication, access control, and application provider are all loosely coupled" while supporting the user stories identified by the Solid project and working group participants.
