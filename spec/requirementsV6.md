## Requirements (Continued)

11. **Offline Access and Synchronization** — The protocol shall allow Entities to access and modify data even when disconnected from the network, with local changes synchronized to the online Storage once connectivity is restored. This includes providing strong guarantees against data corruption and robust conflict resolution to ensure data consistency after offline edits.

12. **Resumable Large Data Transfers** — The protocol shall support efficient handling of large files and data streams, including the ability to resume interrupted uploads/downloads. This ensures that network or server interruptions do not force restarting an entire transfer, improving reliability for big file operations.

13. **Data Versioning** — The protocol shall support maintaining and retrieving previous versions of Resources. Authorized Entities should be able to recover or inspect earlier versions of data (including metadata and access control states) to enable undoing changes, auditing modifications, or recovering from accidental deletions. This helps ensure data durability and traceability over time.

14. **Notification and Eventing** — The protocol shall provide a mechanism to notify relevant Entities of significant events, such as changes to Resources or updates to access permissions. For example, if access rights on a Resource change or new data is available, the affected parties can be alerted in a timely manner. Notification delivery may be real-time (e.g., push/SSE) or via queued channels (e.g., email or inbox), respecting user preferences and privacy.

15. **Access Request Handling** — The protocol shall enable an Entity to request access to a Resource they are currently not authorized to use, and allow the Resource owner (or controller) to review and grant or deny such requests. There should be a standard way for a requester to signal a desire for access (for instance, generating an access request event or message) and for the owner to be notified and respond. This ensures that data owners can easily share data upon request without preemptively granting broad access.

16. **Delegation of Access Rights** — Beyond whole-storage control delegation (Requirement 4), the protocol shall allow an Entity who has certain access rights on a Resource to delegate a subset of those rights to another Entity, if permitted by the original owner. For example, a user granted edit access might delegate *their* edit permission to an assistant for convenience. Such sub-delegation may be temporary or scoped, and the original grantor (or the Resource owner) shall be able to revoke or modify the delegated rights at any time.

17. **Contextual Access Control** — The access control mechanisms shall support context-aware policies. An Entity should be able to impose additional conditions on Resource access based on context such as time windows, location, or group membership status. For instance, a policy could allow access only during certain hours, or only if the requesting party is within a specific role or group at the time. This enables dynamic, real-world contextual factors to inform authorization decisions, enhancing security and flexibility (e.g., enforcing that a Resource is only accessible **until** a certain date, or only when the user is in a given location or proximity to another Entity).

18. **Inter-User Communication** — The protocol shall provide a mechanism for users (or their agents/applications) to exchange messages or data directly via their storages in a standardized way, enabling built-in collaboration without relying on external messaging services. For example, a user should be able to send a message, notification, or invite to another user’s Storage (with appropriate authorization), and the receiving user’s client can retrieve or be alerted to this message. This facilitates features like on-platform direct messaging, event invites, or cross-storage notifications for collaboration purposes.

19. **Search and Query** — The protocol shall support querying of data to help users and applications discover Resources based on content or metadata. It should offer powerful search capabilities (e.g., full-text or attribute-based search) while enforcing the access controls on results (so one can only find what they are allowed to see). To handle large result sets, the protocol **SHALL** provide features like pagination, filtering, and sorting of query results. Additionally, to leverage linked data, the protocol may support standard query languages (such as SPARQL) for advanced semantic queries over the data for clients that need them.

20. **Self-Descriptive and Discoverable APIs** — The protocol shall include means for clients to discover available capabilities and navigate a Storage’s data and access control interfaces uniformly. This could be achieved via hypermedia controls or standard descriptors in responses. For example, responses may include links or metadata (in a known format like JSON-LD) indicating available actions (e.g., edit, share, delete) or endpoints (e.g., an inbox URL for notifications, a description of server capabilities) so that generic clients can function without hard-coding each possible interaction. Servers should provide a discoverable description of the Storage (such as supported protocol versions, extensions, or features), allowing clients to adjust their behavior based on the server’s capabilities (issue [#21](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/21)). This promotes interoperability and ease of use.

21. **End-to-End Encryption** — The protocol shall enable end-to-end encryption of data, such that data stored or transmitted can be made unreadable to anyone except the authorized parties. This means that even Storage Providers or network intermediaries cannot decrypt the content (only the data owner and intended recipients can). End-to-end encryption should be achievable for data at rest and in transit, using standard algorithms, to ensure that sensitive information is protected against unauthorized access or breaches. (This addresses user concerns about confidentiality of their data in a decentralized storage network, per issues [#4](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/4), [#44](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/44).)

22. **Data Integrity Verification** — The protocol shall incorporate mechanisms to ensure and verify the integrity of stored data. Authorized Entities should be able to detect if data has been tampered with or corrupted (whether at rest or in transit). For example, the system may use cryptographic hashes, signatures, or checksums so clients can confirm that a Resource retrieved from Storage is exactly as originally stored by the owner. This guards against undetected data corruption and unauthorized modifications, complementing encryption (which protects confidentiality) with integrity guarantees.

23. **Consent-Based Data Sharing** — The protocol shall provide a means to record and honor user consent for data sharing. When an Entity grants another party access to personal or sensitive data, there should be a verifiable record of that consent (who granted access to whom, for what data, and for what purpose or duration). Such consent receipts or tokens should be auditable (related to Requirement 9’s log) to demonstrate compliance with privacy regulations. The system should allow revocation of consent and ensure that once consent is revoked, access is removed. This requirement ensures that data sharing is transparent and compliant, addressing regulatory needs (issues [#141](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/141), [#81](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/81)).

24. **Legal Basis Enforcement** — The protocol shall support associating access control decisions with legal bases or policies. For example, an enterprise or data controller should be able to tag certain data access rules as being justified under a specific legal ground (such as “Consent – GDPR Article 6(1)(a)” or “Contract – GDPR Article 6(1)(b)”). This meta-information does not change the technical access grant but ensures that any data processing via the protocol can be traced to a legitimate basis. Combined with audit trails, this helps organizations demonstrate compliance with laws like GDPR by showing *why* a particular user or application was given access (issues [#80](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/80), [#77](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/77)). The protocol itself need not enforce the laws but must provide the hooks for implementers to enforce and document such policies.

25. **User-Centric Identity Management** — The protocol shall integrate with identity systems in a way that empowers users to control their credentials and identifiers. Users should be able to manage their identity (e.g., create or use self-sovereign identities or locally stored credentials) without being forced to rely on a single centralized Identity Provider. While new identity mechanisms are out of scope to define in this Working Group, the protocol should accommodate existing standards that allow local or user-controlled identity (such as supporting decentralized identifiers or client-managed credentials) in its authentication flows. This ensures an Entity can prove who they are to a Storage using an identity solution that they trust or operate, aligning with the principle of user autonomy.

26. **Modern Authentication Methods** — The protocol shall support contemporary web authentication methods to enable both high security and ease of use. For instance, it should allow use of passkeys or WebAuthn for passwordless login, support “silent” or non-interactive authentication flows (so scripts or background applications can authenticate without a GUI prompt, given appropriate credentials or tokens), and allow client credentials or token-based auth for automation. This flexibility ensures that a variety of clients (from web browsers to cURL scripts to mobile apps) can authenticate in a user-friendly and secure manner (issues [#39](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/39), [#49](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/49)). All authentication methods must ultimately result in a verified Entity identity that the Storage recognizes.

27. **Trusted Identity Providers** — The protocol shall enable Storage Providers to establish trust relationships with Identity Providers of their choosing, rather than blindly accepting any identity source. In practice, this means a Storage should only accept authentication tokens or credentials from Identity Providers it trusts (configured by policy or through recognized federations). There is no assumption of transitive trust: just because a user trusts a particular IdP for their identity, a Storage Provider is not obligated to trust that IdP unless it explicitly decides to. This requirement ensures that Storage Providers can maintain security by controlling which identity authorities are valid in their ecosystem (issue [#129](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/129)). It complements Requirement 2 by clarifying trust is not universal.

28. **Protocol Binding Independence** — The design of the Linked Web Storage protocol shall be decoupled from any single transfer protocol or encoding. While HTTP(S) is expected to be a primary binding, the core data access and identity interactions should be defined abstractly enough that they could be realized over alternative transports or interfaces (e.g., local inter-process calls, gRPC, GraphQL over WebSocket) without changing the fundamental model. This allows for *local-first* applications that may interact with a local storage using the same logical API, or for future adoption of protocols beyond HTTP. In essence, the protocol’s semantics should not rely on features unique to HTTP; it should be possible to map them to other paradigms if needed (issue [#24](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/24)). This fosters flexibility and longevity of the standard.

29. **Service Integration Authentication** — The protocol shall support secure authentication and authorization flows suitable for server-to-server and backend service integration. In many scenarios, services (like data processors, or IoT feeders, or enterprise backends) need to access a user’s Storage without an interactive login. The protocol should accommodate methods such as mutual TLS authentication, signed JWT-based service credentials, or long-lived tokens with appropriate scope, so that trusted services can connect to Storages securely on behalf of a user or under their own service identity (issues [#40](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/40), [#92](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/92)). This ensures seamless integration for background processes or corporate systems in the Linked Web Storage ecosystem.

30. **Scalable Storage Management** — The protocol shall not assume a one-size-fits-all physical storage per Entity. It should permit flexible management of an Entity’s data across multiple storage units or providers. For example, a user could have their data split across different back-ends (for scalability or jurisdiction reasons) yet treated logically as one Storage, or conversely aggregate multiple small Storages into a larger virtual one. The protocol should accommodate scenarios like migrating a portion of data to a new provider, linking multiple Storages, or splitting data by type, without losing global addressing or control. This flexibility ensures the system can scale and adapt to user needs and provider architectures (issues [#110](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/110), [#136](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/136)). All such complexity should remain behind the protocol interface – to clients and users the Storage should still appear unified and consistent.

31. **Performance and Scalability** — The protocol and its implementations shall be designed for high performance at scale. Access control checks and data operations should incur minimal overhead so that even under heavy load (many requests, many Resources, or many concurrent users) the system remains responsive. The design should consider batching or caching where appropriate, and enable scalable deployment (e.g., allowing a Storage to be distributed or clustered without breaking the protocol semantics). This requirement addresses non-functional expectations: users should experience fast data retrieval and updates, and administrators should be able to scale the service without protocol bottlenecks (issues [#72](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/72)). While exact performance targets are out of scope for the specification, the protocol must not introduce needless inefficiencies that would prevent implementations from meeting typical web performance needs.

32. **Clear Error Messaging** — The protocol shall specify clear and standardized error messages for various failure conditions, so that clients and users can understand and act on errors. Error responses should include meaningful status codes and human-readable information indicating what went wrong (e.g., authentication failure vs. authorization denied vs. malformed request) and possibly how to remediate the issue. This improves the developer experience and user experience by avoiding ambiguous or uninformative errors (issue [#34](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/34)). Consistent and actionable error messaging across implementations helps users quickly resolve issues and fosters trust in the system’s reliability.
