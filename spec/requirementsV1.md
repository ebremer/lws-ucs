## Conclusion

The original 10 requirements address many stories related to storage, access control, identity, and portability. Nine additional requirements (11–19) cover gaps like offline access, notifications, and encryption, all within the charter’s scope. Stories outside the scope (e.g., meeting scheduling) are excluded as they pertain to application logic. This updated list ensures alignment with the charter’s goals.
